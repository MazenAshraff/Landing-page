# My Landing Page

The HTML and CSS of the project was modified from the starter project provided by udacity
as it wasn't the main focus of the project.


the project provides a dynamic navigation bar which contains the sections provided
in the document.

upon clicking a specific item in the navigation bar the document is navigated to it.

the project also allows you to know which section you are currently viewing using a 
fixed div which carries the number of the section currently in view.

I also added a functionality to hide this div if the user found it disturbing.
